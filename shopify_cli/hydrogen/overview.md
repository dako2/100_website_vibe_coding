## hydrogen debug cpu

Builds the app and runs the resulting code to profile the server startup time, watching for changes. This command can be used to [debug slow app startup times](https://shopify.dev/docs/custom-storefronts/hydrogen/debugging/cpu-startup) that cause failed deployments in Oxygen.

  The profiling results are written to a `.cpuprofile` file that can be viewed with certain tools such as [Flame Chart Visualizer for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-js-profile-flame).

## hydrogen deploy

Builds and deploys your Hydrogen storefront to Oxygen. Requires an Oxygen deployment token to be set with the `--token` flag or an environment variable (`SHOPIFY_HYDROGEN_DEPLOYMENT_TOKEN`). If the storefront is [linked](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-link) then the Oxygen deployment token for the linked storefront will be used automatically.

## hydrogen dev

Runs a Hydrogen storefront in a local runtime that emulates an Oxygen worker for development.

  If your project is [linked](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-link) to a Hydrogen storefront, then its environment variables will be loaded with the runtime.

## hydrogen env list

Lists all environments available on the linked Hydrogen storefront.

## hydrogen link

Links your local development environment to a remote Hydrogen storefront. You can link an unlimited number of development environments to a single Hydrogen storefront.

  Linking to a Hydrogen storefront enables you to run [dev](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-dev) and automatically inject your linked Hydrogen storefront's environment variables directly into the server runtime.

  After you run the `link` command, you can access the [env list](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-env-list), [env pull](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-env-pull), and [unlink](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/hydrogen/hydrogen-unlink) commands.
