# hydrogen shortcut

Creates a global h2 shortcut for Shopify CLI using shell aliases.

  The following shells are supported:

  - Bash (using `~/.bashrc`)
  - ZSH (using `~/.zshrc`)
  - Fish (using `~/.config/fish/functions`)
  - PowerShell (added to `$PROFILE`)

  After the alias is created, you can call Shopify CLI from anywhere in your project using `h2 <command>`.

```bash
shopify hydrogen shortcut
```
