# Shopify CLI Theme commands

## theme check

Calls and runs [Theme Check](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-check) to analyze your theme code for errors and to ensure that it follows theme and Liquid best practices. [Learn more about the checks that Theme Check runs.](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/theme-check/checks)
[View theme check](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-check)

## theme console

Starts the Shopify Liquid REPL (read-eval-print loop) tool. This tool provides an interactive terminal interface for evaluating Liquid code and exploring Liquid objects, filters, and tags using real store data.

  You can also provide context to the console using a URL, as some Liquid objects are context-specific

## theme delete

Deletes a theme from your store.

  You can specify multiple themes by ID. If no theme is specified, then you're prompted to select the theme that you want to delete from the list of themes in your store.

  You're asked to confirm that you want to delete the specified themes before they are deleted. You can skip this confirmation using the `--force` flag.

## theme dev


  Uploads the current theme as the specified theme, or a [development theme](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli#development-themes), to a store so you can preview it.

This command returns the following information:

- A link to your development theme at http://127.0.0.1:9292. This URL can hot reload local changes to CSS and sections, or refresh the entire page when a file changes, enabling you to preview changes in real time using the store's data.

  You can specify a different network interface and port using `--host` and `--port`.

- A link to the [editor](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/online-editor) for the theme in the Shopify admin.

- A [preview link](https://help.shopify.com/manual/online-store/themes/adding-themes#share-a-theme-preview-with-others) that you can share with other developers.

If you already have a development theme for your current environment, then this command replaces the development theme with your local theme. You can override this using the `--theme-editor-sync` flag.

> Note: You can't preview checkout customizations using http://127.0.0.1:9292.

Development themes are deleted when you run `shopify auth logout`. If you need a preview link that can be used after you log out, then you should [share](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-share) your theme or [push](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/shopify-cli/theme/theme-push) to an unpublished theme on your store.

You can run this command only in a directory that matches the [default Shopify theme folder structure](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli#directory-structure).

## theme duplicate

If you want to duplicate your local theme, you need to run `shopify theme push` first.

If no theme ID is specified, you're prompted to select the theme that you want to duplicate from the list of themes in your store. You're asked to confirm that you want to duplicate the specified theme.

Prompts and confirmations are not shown when duplicate is run in a CI environment or the `--force` flag is used, therefore you must specify a theme ID using the `--theme` flag.

You can optionally name the duplicated theme using the `--name` flag.

If you use the `--json` flag, then theme information is returned in JSON format, which can be used as a machine-readable input for scripts or continuous integration.

Sample JSON output:

```json
{
  "theme": {
    "id": 108267175958,
    "name": "A Duplicated Theme",
    "role": "unpublished",
    "shop": "mystore.myshopify.com"
  }
}
```

```json
{
  "message": "The theme 'Summer Edition' could not be duplicated due to errors",
  "errors": ["Maximum number of themes reached"],
  "requestId": "12345-abcde-67890"
}

  > Caution: If you're building a theme for the Shopify Theme Store, then you can use our example theme as a starting point. However, the theme that you submit needs to be [substantively different from existing themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/store/requirements#uniqueness) so that it provides added value for users.
