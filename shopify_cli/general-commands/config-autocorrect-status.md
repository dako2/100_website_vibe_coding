# config autocorrect status

Check whether autocorrect is enabled or disabled. On by default.

  When autocorrection is enabled, Shopify CLI automatically runs a corrected version of your command if a correction is available.

  When autocorrection is disabled, you need to confirm that you want to run corrections for mistyped commands.


```bash
shopify config autocorrect status
```
